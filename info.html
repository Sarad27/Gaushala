        <img src="img/Home/1.jpg" style="width:80%">
      <p>Nepal is an agricultural country and therefore, cattle like goats,cows,buffaloes etc are raised for farming and livestock. Cows are worshipped and venerated as part of religious act. She is also the mother of bull, the chairot of Lord Shiva, known as Nandi. Since bulls are forbidden to yoke and plough near Pashupatinath area, they are freed after they are offered to Shiva in every full moon worship.<br><br>Those keeping cows in cities and adjacent area don't prefer to have a male calf, therefore, they are thrown in the street of Kathmandu and are unable to get maternal love. So, bulls and oxes are seen in every nook and corner of the Kathmandu city. All these abandoned cattle come to throng in the street in search of their means of survival. They reamin stranded in busy traffic throughfare, very riskily surviving. In no time, possibilities of being dashed or run over by vehicles, injured or killed is very high. Who cares their right of life? Are they not living beings? Should not the violators of such rights subjected to punishment? <br><br> The mother of such abandoned baby calves also have to meted with still more severe form of casualties as they grew older and are unable to lactate. They are also thrown in the streets of Kathmandu valley. A lot of them can be seen on the street but who care? These are current situation of animal and their rights in the major cities of Nepal.</p>
      <h3 style="color:#564940"><b>Is there any rescuer?</b></h3>
        <p>Yes, though very late, there has been maintained a small cow shed (Gaushala) in the vicinity of Pashupati Bankali area where a number of such bulls along with abandoned calves and aged cows are kept and cared in private scale by the efforts of some pious people. One can visit here and offer help along with volunteering.</p>
